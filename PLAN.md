  }
}
```

## Dual LLM System - Technical Details

### Phase 1: Reaction System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- Decision LLM analyzes user messages and decides on emoji reactions
- Reactions appear rarely (1 in 5 messages) on emotionally significant messages
- Stored in messages table, displayed as badge overlay on user messages
- Separate LLM settings for decision engine (lower temp, fewer tokens)

### Phase 2: Schedule & Engagement System âœ… IMPLEMENTED

#### Character Status System
Four status levels that affect engagement duration and availability:
- **Online**: Available, stays engaged indefinitely during good conversations
- **Away**: Doing something, stays engaged for 30-60 minutes then departs
- **Busy**: Work/important task, stays engaged for 15-30 minutes then departs
- **Offline**: Sleeping/unavailable, no responses until back online

#### Weekly Schedule Structure
Stored as JSON in `characters` table `schedule_data` column:
```json
{
  "schedule": {
    "monday": [
      {"start": "08:00", "end": "17:00", "status": "busy", "activity": "Work"},
      {"start": "17:00", "end": "19:00", "status": "online"},
      {"start": "19:00", "end": "21:00", "status": "away", "activity": "Gym"},
      {"start": "21:00", "end": "23:00", "status": "online"},
      {"start": "23:00", "end": "08:00", "status": "offline", "activity": "Sleep"}
    ],
    // ... tuesday-sunday
  },
  "responseDelays": {
    "online": [30, 120],      // seconds
    "away": [300, 1200],      // 5-20min
    "busy": [900, 3600],      // 15-60min
    "offline": null
  }
}
```

#### Time-Based Engagement System
Realistic conversation flow based on time durations:

**1. Initial Response**
- When disengaged: 70% chance to engage and respond, 30% no response
- Fast response delay (~1 second) for all responses
- No more status-based long delays

**2. Engagement Duration**
- Once engaged, character stays engaged for a duration based on their status:
  - **Online**: Unlimited (stays in conversation)
  - **Away**: 30-60 minutes
  - **Busy**: 15-30 minutes
- Timer starts when engagement begins

**3. Natural Departure**
- When duration expires, character sends natural departure message:
  - Content LLM generates "gtg" message using schedule context
  - Examples: "gotta get back to work", "friends are here, ttyl!"
- Character enters cooldown state

**4. Cooldown Period**
- After departing, character won't respond until their status changes
- Status change clears cooldown, character can engage again

**Example Flow:**
```
10:00 AM - User: "How's your day going?"
          [Character is away, disengaged]

10:00 AM - Char: "Hey! Pretty hectic, but good ðŸ˜Š"
          [Engaged, 45min duration (away status)]

10:01 AM - User: "What are you working on?"
10:01 AM - Char: "Just finishing up a big presentation"

10:02 AM - User: "Nice! How's it going?"
10:02 AM - Char: "Going well! Almost done"

... conversation continues naturally ...

10:45 AM - User: "That's awesome!"
10:45 AM - Char: "Thanks! Gotta get back to it, talk later?"
          [Duration expired, natural departure]
          [Now on cooldown until status changes from "away"]

11:00 AM - User: "Sure thing!"
          [No response - on cooldown]
```

#### Database Schema
**characters table**:
- `schedule_data` JSON - Weekly schedule with status blocks
- `schedule_generated_at` TIMESTAMP - When schedule was generated

**character_states table** (per user-character pair):
- `current_status` TEXT - Current calculated status (online/away/busy/offline)
- `engagement_state` TEXT - engaged/disengaged
- `engagement_started_at` TIMESTAMP - When current engagement began (for duration tracking)
- `departed_status` TEXT - Status when character departed (for cooldown until status changes)
- `last_check_time` TIMESTAMP - Last state update time

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Schedule Generation** (Library UI)
   - "Generate Schedule" button on character cards
   - LLM generates realistic weekly schedule based on character description
   - User can preview/edit before saving
   - Stored when character is liked/matched

2. **Status Calculation** (Backend)
   - `GET /api/characters/:id/status` - Calculate current status from schedule + time
   - Returns: `{ status, activity, nextStatusChange, lastSeen }`

3. **Engagement Logic** (Decision Engine)
   - Check engagement state before responding
   - If engaged â†’ respond quickly, decrement counter, decide on disengagement
   - If not engaged â†’ decide if character "checks phone" (time-based probability)
   - If checking phone â†’ start new engagement window (2-5 messages)

4. **Frontend Display** (Chat UI)
   - Status badge in chat header (colored dot + text)
   - Activity text if present ("At work", "At the gym")
   - "Last seen X minutes ago" for offline characters
   - Typing indicator delay matches engagement state

5. **Message Queueing** (Backend)
   - Messages sent while character is offline â†’ added to queue
   - When character comes online â†’ process queue with engagement logic
   - Decision engine can decide to respond to multiple queued messages at once

#### Implementation Notes (Phase 2)
**Completed Features:**
- âœ… Database schema: Added `schedule_data` and `schedule_generated_at` columns to characters table
- âœ… Database schema: Created `character_states` table with `engagement_started_at` and `departed_status` columns
- âœ… Backend service: Created `engagementService.js` for state management and time-based engagement tracking
- âœ… Schedule generation: LLM generates plaintext schedules, parsed into JSON
- âœ… Status calculation: Real-time status from schedule + current time
- âœ… Time-based engagement: Online (unlimited), Away (30-60min), Busy (15-30min)
- âœ… Natural departures: Content LLM generates contextual "gtg" messages when duration expires
- âœ… Cooldown system: Characters blocked from responding until status changes after departure
- âœ… Fast response delays: All responses ~0.5-2 seconds (no more status-based delays)
- âœ… Frontend UI: Schedule tab in character profile with generation button
- âœ… Frontend UI: Status display in chat header with colored badges
- âœ… Frontend UI: AI reply suggestion buttons (serious, sarcastic, flirty)

**Technical Details:**
- Plaintext schedule format preferred over JSON (more reliable, fewer tokens)
- 70% engagement probability on first message when disengaged, 30% no response
- Engagement duration tracked programmatically, not by Decision LLM
- Departure messages generated by Content LLM with `isDeparting` flag
- Cooldown cleared automatically when character's status changes
- Status colors: green (online), yellow (away), red (busy), gray (offline)
- AI suggestions use conversation context to generate tone-specific user replies

### Proactive Messaging System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Overview**: Characters can send messages first after time gaps, making conversations feel more natural and alive.

**Background Service**:
- Runs every 5 minutes via `setInterval` in `server.js`
- Checks all conversations where last message was from user
- Only considers characters with status = online
- Minimum time gap: 1 hour

**Send Probability Calculation**:
- Base probability: 5% per hour of gap time (capped at 50%)
- Personality modifier: Extraversion trait affects frequency
  - High extraversion (80-100): +25% modifier
  - Low extraversion (0-20): -25% modifier
  - Medium extraversion (40-60): neutral
- Example: After 5 hours with 80 extraversion â†’ 50% (capped) + 20% = 70% chance

**Daily Limits**:
- Maximum 5 proactive messages per day per user
- Counter resets at midnight (tracked in `users` table)
- Global limit prevents spam across all characters

**Decision Engine (Proactive Mode)**:
- Analyzes last 5 messages for conversation context
- Decides: `{ shouldSend: boolean, messageType: "resume"|"fresh"|"callback" }`
- **Resume**: Continue previous topic if conversation was mid-flow
- **Fresh**: Start new conversation if topic naturally ended
- **Callback**: Reference something interesting from earlier

**Content Generation**:
- Uses `isProactive` and `proactiveType` flags in system prompt
- Natural message generation based on type
- No apologies for not responding (character is reaching out!)

**Database Tracking**:
- `users` table: `proactive_messages_today`, `last_proactive_date`
- Automatic daily reset logic

### Big Five Personality System âœ… IMPLEMENTED
**Model**: OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)

**Generation**:
- Small LLM (DeepSeek Chat v3) analyzes character description + personality field
- Rates each trait 0-100 on psychological scales
- Stores in both `personality_data` column (backend) and `personalityTraits` (IndexedDB)

**Traits**:
1. **Openness** (0-100): Curiosity, creativity, openness to new experiences
2. **Conscientiousness** (0-100): Organization, dependability, discipline
3. **Extraversion** (0-100): Sociability, assertiveness, energy around others
4. **Agreeableness** (0-100): Compassion, cooperation, trust in others
5. **Neuroticism** (0-100): Emotional sensitivity vs. stability

**Current Usage**:
- Extraversion affects proactive messaging frequency
- Foundation for future behavioral modeling

**Future Potential**:
- Openness â†’ willingness to try new topics/activities
- Conscientiousness â†’ schedule adherence, message timing
- Agreeableness â†’ conflict handling, compromise
- Neuroticism â†’ mood swings, emotional reactions

**UI**:
- Personality tab in Library (CharacterProfile component)
- Gradient progress bars with color coding
- One-click generation from character description

### Phase 3: Drama Engine ðŸ”® FUTURE
- Random events that affect character mood/availability
- Mood shifts based on conversation content
- Tension/conflict system

### Phase 4: Advanced Orchestration ðŸ”® FUTURE
- Topic routing (different prompts for different subjects)
- Escalation gates (trust/attraction thresholds)
- Long-term memory and relationship progression

### Character State Variables (Future)
Stored in `character_states` table (per user-character pair):
- **current_mood**: happy, stressed, flirty, vulnerable, distant, excited, tired
- **energy_level**: 0-100 (affects response enthusiasm)
- **trust_level**: 0-100 (gates vulnerable content)
- **attraction_level**: 0-100 (affects flirtiness)
- **tension_meter**: 0-100 (drama engine builds/releases tension)
- **current_event**: null, "bad_day", "exciting_news", "feeling_lonely", "conflict_active"
- **secrets_revealed**: JSON array of unlocked backstory elements
- **topics_discussed**: JSON array of conversation topics covered

## Future Ideas (Brainstorm)

### AI Enhancements
- **Model switching per character**: Different models for different characters
- **Memory system**: Long-term character memory across conversations
- **Personality drift**: Character evolves based on conversation history
- **Multiple personas**: One character with different moods/personas

### Technical Improvements
- **RAG integration**: Character books with semantic search
- **Voice cloning**: Unique voice for each character

## Notes
- Built as personal project (single-user focus)
- No production overhead needed (tests, TypeScript, etc.)
- Prioritize features that improve personal UX
- Keep codebase maintainable for solo development
