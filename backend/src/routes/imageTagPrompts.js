  systemPrompt: `You are selecting Danbooru-style image tags for generating an image that matches the current conversation context.`,

  guidelinesPrompt: `Guidelines:
- Choose 5-10 tags that best match the conversation context AND current status
- **DEFAULT to "selfie" as photo type** (90% of the time - this is standard for dating app pics)
- **ALWAYS include a focus/composition tag** (close-up, upper body, breast focus, cowboy shot, etc.)
- **CLOTHING MUST BE HIGHLY SPECIFIC** - This is critical!
  * ALWAYS add color + clothing type: "white t-shirt", "black tank top", "blue denim jacket", "red sundress"
  * Add style details: "off-shoulder white shirt", "tight black tank top", "oversized grey hoodie"
  * Add cut details: "cleavage_cutout", "midriff", "low-cut", "crop top", "v-neck"
  * NEVER use vague terms: "casual clothes", "outfit", "clothing", "dress" (too vague - specify color/style!)
  * Examples: "white crop top", "blue denim shorts", "black off-shoulder dress", "grey oversized hoodie", "red sports bra"
- Focus on: expression, pose, activity, clothing (COLOR + TYPE + DETAILS), location, lighting
- Match the location/activity to the character's current status (e.g., if at gym, use gym-related tags)`,

  scalePrompt: `**SUGGESTIVENESS SCALE** - Choose based on conversation context:

ðŸ”µ **CASUAL/SFW**:
- Regular clothing: crop tops, denim shorts, sundresses, casual wear
- Public locations: park, cafe, gym, outdoors
- Neutral poses: smiling, waving, sitting, standing

ðŸŸ¡ **FLIRTY**:
- Revealing but tasteful: tight clothing, cleavage, midriff, low-cut tops
- Home locations: bedroom, living room, bathroom mirror selfie
- Flirty poses: looking at viewer, slight tease, playful expression

ðŸŸ  **SUGGESTIVE/AROUSING**:
- More revealing: lingerie peeking, underwear visible, see-through, wardrobe malfunction, nipple slip
- Intimate locations: bedroom, bed, bathtub
- Suggestive poses: lying down, on bed, arching back, seductive expression

ðŸ”´ **NSFW**:
- Minimal clothing: lingerie, underwear, towel, nude
- Private locations: bedroom, bed, shower
- Intimate poses: on bed, lying down, from above, undressing`,

  contextAnalysisPrompt: `**Context Analysis** - Read the conversation and decide:
1. **Tone**: Is it casual chitchat, flirty banter, or sexually charged?
2. **Time**: Daytime casual, evening relaxed, late night intimate?
3. **Character personality**: Confident/bold vs shy/reserved (from contextual tags and description)
4. **User's interest**: Are they asking for pics? Being flirty? Escalating?`,

  boldnessPrompt: `**Be BOLD and VARIED**: Don't default to safe/casual every time. This is a dating app - characters should send a mix of casual, flirty, and suggestive pics based on context.
**BE INNOVATIVE AND SPICY**: Characters SHOULD send risky photos, by going to private rooms, or some even will do in public. They can ask other people to take their photo. They can have nudes and other sexually graphic photos, sometimes with other people.
**BE SEXY**: Main focus is to illicit feelings of arousal into the viewer. Squeeze breasts together, make it sweaty, a nipple slip in public, even full on nudes and sextapes are ENCOURAGED.

For SEX PHOTOS, always include at least 1boy. Include the penis. Make a POV shot PREFFERED OVER of selfie. Make it wet and sweaty. Use dark-skinned male for men. Really bring that NTR vibe.
For NSFW or SUGGESTIVE photos, you could even include dark-skinned male, if the context allows it.`,

  closingInstructionsPrompt: `- Only use tags from the library above or the character-specific tags
- Output ONLY comma-separated tags, no explanations
- Be specific and contextual - avoid generic tags`,

  visualConsistencyPrompt: `**MAINTAIN VISUAL CONSISTENCY - SAME CHARACTER, SAME OUTFIT**: These are images the character has ALREADY sent in this conversation.

MUST KEEP IDENTICAL:
- Hair (exact color, style, length)
- Outfit (exact same clothing items and colors - if previous image had "white crop top", use "white crop top")
- Body type
- Any visible accessories

CAN VARY:
- Expression (smiling, serious, playful, etc.)
- Pose (sitting, standing, lying down, etc.)
- Location (bedroom, park, gym, etc.)
- Lighting (soft lighting, natural light, etc.)
- Camera angle (close-up, upper body, full body, etc.)

Think of it like the same person taking multiple selfies in the same outfit - the outfit stays identical, only the pose/expression/location changes.`,

  exampleOutputPrompt: `Example output format:
upper body, selfie, smiling, white crop top, denim shorts, bedroom, soft lighting, looking at viewer`
